# Airbnb Backend Clone

A production-inspired hotel booking backend system built using Spring Boot.

This project focuses on solving real-world backend engineering problems like:
- inventory management
- concurrent bookings
- dynamic pricing
- booking lifecycle
- payment workflow

Instead of building a basic CRUD app, this project is designed around how actual hotel booking systems work internally.

# Database Design

Core entities:
- User
- Hotel
- Room
- Inventory
- Booking
- Guest
- Payment

The system uses an inventory-based approach to handle:

Search Hotel
    ↓
Check Inventory
    ↓
Create Booking
    ↓
Lock Rooms
    ↓
Process Payment
    ↓
Confirm Booking
```
